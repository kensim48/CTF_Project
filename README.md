# CTF Project for 50.042 Foundations of Cybersecurity
This project was created for an SUTD group project submission. All instructions can be see inside `CTF_Instructions.pdf`.
The rest of the files here are to run a Django server to assist the students in completing the CTF.
The server serves 2 purpose:
1. Allows students to check their answers
2. Allows students to generate a Rubik's Cube image equivilence of their encoded message to assist them in their CTF process.

For point 2, the program uses OpenCV to assist in the image generation, sample below.

For more information on how each endpoint works and how the user interacts with the server, see `CTF_Instructions.pdf`.
